Preproduction
    The main goal is to create a simplified real-time version of Castle Panic (A co-op tower defense tabletop).
    Enemies spawn and attack the castle from 6 directions, and players draw cards to defeat them.

Aesthetic goals
    Make players feel pressered and pray to the RNGesus.

Core loop
    Enemy spawn, draw card, play card on enemies.
